## Style Guide

#### When to use comments
Above every function I write a description of that function.
Above larger pieces of code with one goal, I write what this piece of code does.
#### Tabs or Spaces for indentation
For Python, I use the conventional one tab for every subfunction. For HTML I use a tab within blocks, and new lines between divs. My editor has  a function to create automatic indentation in JS files.

#### Appropriate use of white space
Between every chuck of code with a distinct purpose I put a new line. Between functions I put two new lines.

#### Proper naming of variables and functions
In python, different words in variables are separated by an underscore. In JS, different words in variables are separated by a capital letter at the start of the word. Functions are always named in such a way that the name represent what they do.

#### Code grouping and organization
In JS, I made a separate file for every visualization. I have  a folder with static files and one folder containing modules I use from the internet.
