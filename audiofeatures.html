                    maps the energy and danceability of the songs. <br>
                    The color is defined by the genre. You can select genres of your choice by using the checkboxes on
                    the side. Clicking a bubble shows a line chart with all songs of the selected artist that have
                    peaked the charts. <br>

        <h3>Acousticness</h3>
        <p>	A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence
            the track is acoustic.</p>
        <h3>Danceability</h3>
        <p>	Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements
            including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least
            danceable and 1.0 is most danceable. </p>
        <h3>Energy</h3>
        <p>	Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity.
            Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while
            a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include
            dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.</p>
        <h3>Liveness</h3>
        <p>Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased
            probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the
            track is live.</p>
        <h3>Valence</h3>
        <p>	A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high
            valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more
            negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry). </p>
