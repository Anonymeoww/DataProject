### Week 1 - Day 2

### Week 1 - Day 1 (June 3)
Today I changed my proposal for the last time. It turned out that one of the visuals in my design sketch was not linked with the other two. So I discussed this with Nigel, and decided to use the Radio Chart for displaying information about the selected song. I swapped the Bar Chart with a Line Graph that shows information about the position of the songs from the selected artist in the Hot 100. <br> <br>
I made great progress in testing the Spotipy library as well. I managed to find all the audio features of a song, when giving the song title and artist name. I think I can read these from the CSV file that I have, but I will see that tomorrow. <br> <br>
Also, I started working on my design document, just writing down some ideas to work on tomorrow.
